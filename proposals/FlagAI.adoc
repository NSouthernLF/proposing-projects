== RosaeNLG Project Proposal

*Name of project*: RosaeNLG

*Requested project maturity level*: Sandbox

=== Project description

Template-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) automates the production of relatively repetitive texts based on structured input data and textual templates, run by a NLG engine. Production usage is widespread in large corporations, especially in the financial industry.

Typical usecases are:

* describing a product based on its features for SEO purposes
* produce structured reports like risk reports or fund performance in the financial industry
* generate well formed chatbot answers

RosaeNLG is an open source NLG engine. It aims:

* to offer the same NLG features as product NLG solutions
* to be developer and IT friendly for template configuration and integration
* to provide NLG on both server-side and browser-side


=== Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission

NLG is a brick to *build business services directly aimed at final users*. It is widely used in the industry.

NLG concurs to *democratization and understandability of AI*:

* Non-expert users don’t understand figures and dashboards and prefer textual explanations
* Computer-generated texts can be superior (from the reader's perspective) to human-written texts
* At the end of an AI pipeline, NLG can *automate and convey expertise, explain and summarize situations*, and communicate with end users
* Bring *trusted AI*, typically in collaboration with https://ai-explainability-360.org/[AI Explainability 360] and http://aif360.mybluemix.net/[AI Fairness 360]

RosaeNLG project will also:

* Increase diversity: first project *originated in France*
* Foster usage, contributions and diversity in *NLG domain*, supporting languages presently not covered by any NLG system at all


=== Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects

RosaeNLG currently runs on Acumos for Orange AI Marketplace.

RosaeNLG can be used at the end of the AI pipeline, to *explain a decision* to non-experts:

* https://ai-explainability-360.org/[AI Explainability 360]: provide a clear, readable, summarized explanation for an end user (e.g. Bank Customer) asking for explanations
* http://aif360.mybluemix.net/[AI Fairness 360]: generate comprehensive compliance reports on fairness (initial situation, what was done, final situation)

Potential usage of https://mlflow.org/[MLflow], especially Model Registry, to manage templates.

=== External dependencies including licenses (name and version) of those dependencies

RosaeNLG is a fork of the https://pugjs.org/[Pug] template engine (MIT).

It is composed of 70 submodules. Most of these modules are an original part of RosaeNLG, with the same Apache 2.0 license, and are not listed below.

Depending on the output language, RosaeNLG will load some linguistic resources and use linguistic libraries, to make agreements and to conjugate verbs.

Resources derived from linguistic resources (mainly `WordNet`, `lefff`, `german-pos-dict`, `morph-it`) remain under their original licence.
