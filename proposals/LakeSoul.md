### Name of proposed project: 

LakeSoul

### Requested project maturity level: 

Incubation

### Project Description:

LakeSoul is an end-to-end realtime Lakehouse framework for both BI and AI applications. LakeSoul includes a centralized metadata layer on PostgreSQL to manage large scale of tables, partitions and files on data lakes with supports of concurrent row-level upserts and ACID control. LakeSoul also provides tools to ingest data from RDBMS CDC streams and Kafka log streams in realtime, with automatic table/topic discovery and DDL synchronization. Data managed by LakeSoul is stored in Apache Parquet format and is accessed via a native Parquet IO layer optimized for cloud storages. Access layers are provided for big data engines like Spark and AI engines like PyTorch, so that both BI and AI applications can benefit from realtime Lakehouse.

More information in GitHub: https://github.com/meta-soul/LakeSoul and in documentation: https://www.dmetasoul.com/en/docs/lakesoul/intro/ .

### Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission:

We would like to build an opensource community that encourages collaboration and contribution, develop an opensource ecology, and contribute its value to AI and Data opensource community. We believe that such a goal is in line with LF AI&Data's mission .

### Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects: (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)

LakeSoul provides a Lakehouse framework to enable large scale data ingestion, management and query. It could be used to build data source for various LF AI hosted projects, including data processing projects like Sparklyr, and AI feature/sample building projects like feast and feathr.
