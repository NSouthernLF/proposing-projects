### Name of proposed project: 

Intersectional Fairness

### Requested project maturity level: 

Sandbox

### Project Description:

Intersectional Fairness (ISF) is a bias mitigation technology for intersectional bias caused by combinations of multiple protected attributes.  
ISF adopts existing approaches that mitigate bias caused by a single protected attribute to make a machine learning model fair from intersectional bias.
Approaches applicable to ISF are pre-, in-, and post-processing. For now, ISF supports Adversarial Debiasing, Equalized Odds, Massaging, and Reject Option Classification.

### Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission:

We would like to build an opensource community that encourages collaboration and contribution, develop an opensource ecology, and contribute its value to AI and Data opensource community. We believe that such a goal is in line with LF AI&Data's mission .

### Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects: (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)

AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) is the best collaboration candidate since this project develops the de-fact standard toolkit “AI Fairness 360” to help detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models throughout the AI application lifecycle.

By incorporating ISF technology in AIF360, more researchers and real applicators can know ISF so that they can use this new technology with less labor with their regular procedures.
