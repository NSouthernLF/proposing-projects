## OpenFL Project Proposal

### Name of project — or proposed name (must be unique within LF AI):
[OpenFL](https://github.com/intel/openfl)

### Requested project maturity level: 
Incubation

### Project description:
OpenFL is a Python 3 library for federated learning that enables organizations to collaboratively train a model without sharing sensitive information.

[Federated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning) is a distributed machine learning approach that enables collaboration on machine learning projects without sharing sensitive data, such as patient records, financial data, or classified secrets (McMahan, 2016; Sheller, Reina, Edwards, Martin, & Bakas, 2019; Yang, Liu, Chen, & Tong, 2019; Sheller et al., 2020). In federated learning, the model moves to meet the data rather than the data moving to meet the model. The movement of data across the federation are the model parameters and their updates.

OpenFL is Deep Learning framework-agnostic. Training of statistical models may be done with any deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, via a plugin mechanism.

###	Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission:
Our goal is to create a robust ecosystem for industry-wide standardization of the federated learning concept. We want to move the project out of “Intel Open Source” to a neutral 3rd party community-based foundation where other ecosystem players can collaborate, contribute, and use the open-source FL framework. We are eager to join a growing ecosystem of LF AI & Data and contribute to an open AI community.

### Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? Please explain.
The proposed project has possible collaboration opportunities with other federated learning projects (FATE, Substra) and Pytorch.
