## Elyra Project Proposal

*Name of the project*: Elyra, Elyra Pipelines

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation

*Description*: Elyra is an open-source low code / no code framework for creating reproducible, scalable and component based data science pipelines. It allows senior data scientist to create reusable componentes easily. Citizen data scientists can reuse their code without programming skills. MLOps engineers are provided with tested and maintainable deliverables, and scale on Kubeflow, Airflow and others.

*Alignment with LF AI & Dataâ€™s mission*: Elyra is not reinventing the wheel. In contrast, it allows for consumption of existing LF AI projects in a streamlined, stable and reproducible way.
