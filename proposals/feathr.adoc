== Feathr Project Proposal

*Name of the project*: Feathr

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation

*Description*

Feathr is an enterprise-grade, high-performance feature store. Feathr automatically computes your feature values and joins them to your training data, using point-in-time-correct semantics to avoid data leakage, and supports materializing and deploying your features for use online in production.

*Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? Please explain:*

* Milvus as databases to store embeddings features via Feathr.
* JanusGraph as databases to store graph-like features via Feathr. 
* OpenLineage for our feature lineage metadata tracking.
