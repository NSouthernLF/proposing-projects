== SapientML Project Proposal

* Name of project: SapientML

* Requested project maturity level: Sandbox

* Project description: Automatic machine learning, commonly referred to as AutoML, holds great promise in democratizing the utilization of machine learning (ML) by automating a large portion of the work typically performed by data scientists. However, the vast search space of potential pipelines poses a challenge, often resulting in suboptimal or no pipelines being generated, particularly when dealing with large and complex datasets. SapientML addresses this issue by leveraging a collection of pre-existing datasets and their human-created pipelines, enabling efficient generation of high-quality pipelines for new datasets with predictive tasks. With SapientML, data scientists can rapidly create and amend AI models, as the code is provided along with detailed explanations. Furthermore, citizen data scientists can easily create the desired AI models as well.

* Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission.: AutoML plays a vital role in democratizing AI and has the potential to extend the benefits of AI to a wider audience.
