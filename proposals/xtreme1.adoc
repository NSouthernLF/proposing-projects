== Xtreme1 Project Proposal
*Name of project*: Xtreme1

*Requested project maturity level*: Sandbox 

== Project description

Xtreme1 is the next generation open source platform for multisensory training data. It accelerates the modelling process by advanced AI-powered tools, thounsands projects distilled ontologies and plentiful data curation features.
Xtreme1 provides value to the AI community by:

1. Supports labeling tools for image, 3D LiDAR point cloud, 2D/3D Fusion, etc.;
2. Supports pre-labeling and interactive labeling for 2D/3D object detection, segmentation and classification;
3. Ontology center for sharing AI problem definitions of object classes and data attributes in your model training;
4. Supports data visualization, organization, versioning, validation, consensus, analysis, etc.;
5. Supports engineer friendly open API and SDK for quick integration and development.

=== Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission
Xtreme1 would help users to govern and crurate their training data with full open-source techonlogies.
The LF AI & Data can help Xtreme1 to reach a wider audience of users and developers and become a sustainable project with long-term support.
