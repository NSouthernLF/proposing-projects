=== Name of proposed project:

DeepCausality

=== Requested project maturity level:

Sandbox

=== Project Description:

DeepCausality is the first hyper-geometric computational causality library for Rust that enables fast and deterministic context aware causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. Deep Causality adds only minimal overhead, and thus is suitable for real-time applications without additional acceleration hardware.


How is deep causality different from deep learning?

* Free of the independent and identically distributed data (IID) assumption.
* Deterministic and explainable causal reasoning.
* Reasoning over causal collection, graph, or hyper-graph structure supported.

A focus of this repository is to build state of the art computational causality for Rust

=== Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission:

We aim to build an opensource community that encourages collaboration and learning of computational causality and seeks to explore novel applications. We believe that such a goal is in line with LF AI&Data's mission .

=== Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects: (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)

DeepCausality provides fundamental causal datastructures and algorithms and as such is open
to collaboration in many different fields. Potential projects for colleaboration might be:

* 1chipML
* ForestFlow
* Xtreme1
