### Name of proposed project: 

Recommenders

### Requested project maturity level: 

Incubation

### Project Description:

Recommenders is an open-source Github repository for helping researchers, developers and non-experts in general to prototype, experiment with and bring to production both classic and state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. 
A focus of this repository is to provide examples as Jupyter notebooks and develop best practices for building recommendation systems.

### Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission:

We would like to build an opensource community that encourages collaboration and learning of recommendation systems and machine learning in general. We believe that such a goal is in line with LF AI&Data's mission .

### Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects: (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)

Recommenders provides algorithms and examples in the area of recommendation systems. Some candidate projects that can be used with Recommenders are Horovod for distributed training, ONNX for inference, AI Explainability and AI Explainability for ethical AI.
