## CLAIMED Project Proposal

*Name of the project*: CLAIMED, Component Library for AI, Machine Learning, ETL and Data Science

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation (Sandbox)

*Description*: CLAIMED is an open-source low code / no code component library for creating reproducible, scalable, trusted and auditable component based Data & AI pipelines using visual pipeline editors, docker, KNative or shell scripts. It allows senior data scientists to create reusable components easily. Citizen data scientists can reuse their code without programming skills and easily verify/modify their work. MLOps engineers are provided with tested and maintainable deliverables which scale on Kubernetes. Currently, apart from IBM's commercial pipeline editor, the Elyra pipeline editor is supported. CLAIMED comes with a component compiler which turn code assets (e.g. jupyter notebook) into executable Kubeflow Pipeline components. The generated container images are self-contained and also run on (local) docker or KNative. Additional exporters are planned (e.g. Airflow, Apache Nifi, SLURM)

*Alignment with LF AI & Dataâ€™s mission*: CLAIMED is not reinventing the wheel. In contrast, it allows for consumption of existing LF AI projects in a streamlined, stable and reproducible way. It democratizes Data & AI. Facilitates
verification, repetition and all aspects of TrustedAI.
